It allows us to reserve bench time, confirm parts availability, and prioritise your repair. This is especially important for same day repairs and for any express service requests.</p><p>If you are sending your device in, you can place an order online and follow the shipping instructions.

Most repairs do not affect data, but storage can never be guaranteed if a device has underlying faults, liquid damage, or an unstable power issue.</p><p>If your device is still usable, back up before bringing it in. For phones and tablets, an iCloud backup is usually the fastest option. For computers, use Time Machine or another full backup method.</p><p>If the device is not turning on or is too unstable to back up, we can advise on the safest next step after inspection.

That can include detailed functional testing, internal inspection, and where relevant, board level investigation to isolate the area causing the fault. The goal is to provide a clear answer, not guesswork.</p><p>Once diagnostics are complete, we send you a report explaining what we found and what the recommended repair path is.

If a diagnostic service was required to identify the issue, the diagnostic fee still applies because it covers the inspection, testing, and reporting work.</p><p>For advanced faults, especially where a device has multiple issues or severe liquid damage, we will always explain the risks and likely outcomes before proceeding. If a repair attempt is not viable, we stop and report back rather than pushing forward and wasting your time and money.</p><p>Either way, you get a clear result and a practical recommendation, whether that is a different repair approach, a partial recovery path, or advising against repair.</p>",

We take a repair first approach where it makes technical and financial sense.</p><p>Board faults can present as no power, charging issues, random shutdowns, boot loops, or missing functions like audio, cameras, or connectivity. In many cases the board can be restored by repairing the affected circuit area rather than replacing the entire device.</p><p>These repairs require proper diagnostics and specialist equipment. If we find that a board repair would not be reliable or would not represent good value, we will explain the situation clearly and recommend the most practical alternative.</p>",

In that case, we will confirm the diagnostic fee and timeline, then provide a full quote once the fault is identified.</p><p>We do not add hidden charges at the end.

It also does not cover general wear and tear, for example normal battery ageing over time.</p><p>If you ever have an issue after a repair, we will inspect the device and explain exactly what is going on.

It also reduces compatibility issues that can happen with low quality aftermarket parts, and it is a more sustainable way to repair electronics.</p><p>For older models where original parts are no longer realistically available in good condition, we use high quality OEM alternatives.

This allows us to verify functions like cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, charging behaviour, display and touch performance, and general stability before returning the device.</p><p>We do not access personal content, banking apps, or private data. The passcode is used only to reach the testing screens needed to confirm the device is working correctly.</p><p>If you prefer not to share a passcode, we can still complete many repairs.

For diagnostic led repairs, we will provide a quote after inspection, and you can then proceed using the available payment methods once the repair plan is confirmed.</p><p>If you are not sure which route to take, start with diagnostics or contact us with the device model and symptoms.
