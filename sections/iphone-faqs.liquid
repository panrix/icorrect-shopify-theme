These issues often happen when the iPhone is dropped and the two layers of the logic board start to separate.</p><p>If your iPhone is not powering on, not charging, or has been declared “dead” by another repair centre, there’s still a good chance we can bring it back to life.</p>",

On models where a genuine battery is no longer available, we use high-quality OEM replacements. These still show battery health in settings, but the message may not include Apple’s verification tag.</p><p>We’ll always tell you exactly what battery is being used and why.

This makes it far more repair-friendly, and we can replace just the glass using a genuine part.</p><p>However, for most earlier models, including the iPhone 14 Pro and anything before it, the rear glass is fused to the frame. In these cases, the entire housing needs to be replaced to maintain structural integrity, wireless charging alignment, and proper waterproofing.</p><p>You may have seen cheaper back glass-only repairs offered for these older models, but the quality is poor and they tend to crack easily.

Our only goal is to confirm that everything is working as it should once the repair is complete.</p><p>If you prefer not to share your passcode, we can still carry out the repair.
