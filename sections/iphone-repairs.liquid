  CUSTOMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Update banner title and subtitle in the Hero Banner section
  2. Replace placeholder collection URLs with your actual Shopify collection URLs
     (Look for /collections/... links throughout the page)
  3. Replace video IDs: Change "dQw4w9WgXcQ" to your YouTube video IDs
     (Only use the ID part, not the full URL. E.g., if your video is 
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123, use just "ABC123")
  4. Modify any text content as needed to match your brand voice

  <!-- FAQ Section -->
  <section class="faq-section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions - iPhone Repair</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long does an iPhone repair take?</h3>
      <p>Most common iPhone repairs, such as screen replacements and battery changes, are completed within 30 minutes to 1 hour while you wait. More complex repairs like charging port replacements or water damage restoration may take 2-4 hours. We always provide an estimated completion time when you book your repair, and we will notify you immediately if we discover any additional issues that might extend the repair time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you offer same-day iPhone repair services?</h3>
      <p>Yes! We offer same-day repair services for most iPhone issues at our repair centres. For screen repairs, battery replacements, and charging port fixes, we typically complete repairs the same day you bring your device in-often within an hour. For more complex repairs or mail-in services, we aim to complete and return your iPhone within 24 to 48 hours. Contact us to check availability for your specific repair and location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Will my iPhone repair come with a warranty?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. All our iPhone repairs include a comprehensive warranty covering both parts and labour. Screen repairs and battery replacements come with a 12-month warranty, while other component repairs typically include a 6-month warranty. If you experience any issues with your repair during the warranty period, we will fix it free of charge. Our warranty demonstrates our confidence in the quality of our workmanship and the premium parts we use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you use genuine Apple parts for iPhone repairs?</h3>
      <p>We use high-quality aftermarket parts that meet or exceed original specifications. While we're not an Apple Authorised Service Provider, our parts are carefully sourced from trusted suppliers and tested to ensure they match OEM quality standards. For newer iPhone models, we stock premium-grade screens with features like True Tone compatibility and original-quality OLED displays. All parts come with warranties and are thoroughly tested before installation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you repair water-damaged iPhones?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we specialise in water damage restoration for iPhones. Our process includes ultrasonic cleaning of the logic board, corrosion removal, component-level diagnostics, and replacement of any damaged parts. Success rates vary depending on how quickly you bring in your device and the severity of the damage. We recommend not attempting to charge or power on a water-damaged iPhone-bring it to us as soon as possible for the best chance of recovery. We offer free diagnostics to assess water damage and provide honest recommendations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What iPhone models do you repair?</h3>
      <p>We repair all iPhone models, from the original iPhone and iPhone 3G through to the latest iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Plus. Our technicians are trained on all generations of iPhones and we maintain a comprehensive parts inventory for both current and legacy models. Whether you have an iPhone SE, iPhone 11, iPhone 13 Pro, or any other model, we have the expertise and parts to complete your repair professionally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much does iPhone screen repair cost?</h3>
      <p>iPhone screen repair costs vary depending on your specific model. Older models like the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 typically cost less to repair (£50-£80), while newer models with OLED displays like the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max cost more (£150-£280). We provide transparent, upfront pricing with no hidden fees. Visit our screen repair pricing page or contact us with your iPhone model for an exact quote. All screen repairs include a warranty and are completed by certified technicians.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Will I lose my data during the iPhone repair?</h3>
      <p>In most cases, no. Repairs like screen replacements, battery changes, and charging port fixes do not affect your data at all. However, we always recommend backing up your iPhone before any repair as a precautionary measure. For logic board repairs or more complex issues, there's a possibility of data loss, which we will discuss with you upfront. We never intentionally erase or access your data-your privacy and security are our top priorities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you fix my iPhone if the screen is completely black?</h3>
      <p>Yes, in many cases. A black screen can be caused by several issues: a damaged display, a faulty battery, a loose connection, or software problems. Our diagnostic service will identify the root cause. If it's a screen issue, we can replace the display. If it's battery-related or a connection problem, we will address that accordingly. Bring your iPhone in for a free diagnostic assessment, and we will determine the best solution to get your device working again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need to book an appointment for iPhone repair?</h3>
      <p>While walk-ins are welcome at all our locations, we recommend booking an appointment to ensure minimal waiting time and guaranteed same-day service. Booking ahead allows us to allocate a technician and reserve the necessary parts for your specific iPhone model. You can book online through our website, call us directly, or use our live chat. For urgent repairs, contact us and we will do our best to accommodate you as quickly as possible, even without an appointment.</p>
