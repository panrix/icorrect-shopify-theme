That could mean anything from replacing a burned out MOSFET or shorted capacitor to rebuilding complete circuits after liquid damage. We revive boards others declare dead and we do it every day.</p><p>It is precise, delicate work, but it saves clients hundreds compared to Apple, keeps original data intact, and reduces electronic waste.</p><p>If Apple said your MacBook is not fixable and that you need a new one, there is a good chance we will prove them wrong.</p>",
