When it degrades, everything slows down. That’s because your iPhone constantly manages power between its processor, display, and internal systems. If the battery can’t supply stable energy, the system slows performance to prevent crashes.<\/p><p><br\/>At iCorrect, we use original Apple batteries with a genuine BMS (battery management system). That means your iPhone reads the battery properly, retains full battery health tracking, and doesn’t suffer from unexpected shutdowns or throttled performance.<\/p><p><br\/>We don’t use cheap cells. No inflated battery stats. No fake recalibrations. Whether you’ve had a dodgy battery fitted elsewhere or your iPhone’s never been repaired, we’ll restore it back to proper health using tested, reliable, and calibrated components.<\/p>","btn":"","link":"","btn_2":"","link_2":"","heading_size_desktop":38,"heading_size_mobile":24,"heading_line_height_desktop":46,"heading_line_height_mobile":36}},"iphone_videos_PKKhN7":{"type":"iphone-videos","name":"iPhone Videos","settings":{"heading":"Behind the scenes","subtitle":"Watch our videos to understand common repair issues, what to expect, and how we fix your device with care.","video_1_title":"We specialise in data recovery.","video_2_title":"Do not compromise on quality.","video_3_title":"Poor quality parts cause serious issues.","color_scheme":"scheme-4","padding_top":44,"padding_bottom":80}},"repair_services_nQkwFT":{"type":"repair-services","blocks":{"service_PEi9BF":{"type":"service","settings":{"icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Service_icon_Walk-in.png","heading":"Walk-In Service","details":"For clients based in Central London who wish to visit us, we operate a  walk-in drop-off service by appointment.
