But this is not true. In most cases, we can repair the heart rate sensor by replacing the affected module with an original one. It is faster, more sustainable, and significantly more affordable than replacing the entire watch.<\/p><p><br\/>We complete this repair using the same techniques Apple uses in its own factory workflow. The back sensor is securely bonded to the housing and sealed properly to retain water resistance for daily wear. Repairs typically take two to three working days, allowing time for full resealing and post-repair testing.<\/p><p><br\/>If your Apple Watch is not tracking your heart rate, giving inaccurate ECG results, or has a cracked rear sensor glass, book it in.
