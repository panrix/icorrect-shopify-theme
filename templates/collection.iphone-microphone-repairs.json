We complete every repair with full pre and post-testing to confirm which microphone is affected and verify complete functionality before returning the device.</p><p><br/>For complex audio issues where all microphones are failing or audio does not work at all, we may recommend a full diagnostic to check the underlying circuitry on the logic board.
