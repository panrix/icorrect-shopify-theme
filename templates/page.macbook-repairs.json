If you need it sooner, we offer an Express MacBook Repair service, allowing next-day or same-day repairs if booked in advance.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>What warranty do you offer?</strong></h3>\n<p>We provide a two-year warranty on all MacBook repairs, covering issues related to the repair. Whether it’s a screen replacement, battery repair, or logic board fix, our warranty ensures long-term reliability. Accidental damage isn’t covered, but we’re happy to help if new issues arise.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>Do you repair damaged MacBook logic boards?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. This is the advanced work we’re known for. While most repair centres, including Apple, will quote you for a full logic board replacement, we repair boards properly at microchip level.</p>\n<p>Our technicians diagnose faults under a microscope, repairing power circuits, charging issues, liquid damage, and component failures. We revive boards others declare unfixable while keeping your data intact and massively reducing electronic waste.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>Do you use original parts?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes, around 90% of the parts we use are original Apple parts, professionally disassembled from genuine devices. This allows us to maintain Apple-level quality without unnecessary waste. For older models where original batteries aren’t available, we use the best OEM alternatives.</p>\n<p>This approach preserves features such as True Tone, battery health monitoring, and ensures long-term reliability.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>What if my MacBook repair doesn’t resolve the issue?</strong></h3>\n<p>If a repair doesn’t fully resolve the issue, we won’t charge you for it. Our no-fix, no-fee policy applies to all standard MacBook repairs. For logic board diagnostics, if repair is not possible, we’ll recommend an alternative such as board replacement or data recovery.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>Can I get my MacBook repaired quicker?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. Express MacBook Repair Service is available for urgent cases. When pre-booked, most express repairs are completed within one working day, sometimes even the same day. This includes screen, battery, and logic board repairs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>What is your diagnostic process for MacBook repairs?</strong></h3>\n<p>We run a deep, component-level diagnostic using microscopes and electrical testing equipment. This includes checking the power rails, charging circuits, SSD health, liquid damage, and internal communication lines. You receive a full breakdown before work begins.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>Do you offer payment plans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. We offer flexible payment options including Klarna and PayPal Pay in 3. These allow you to split the cost of your repair while keeping your MacBook running without delay.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<h3><strong>Do you repair older MacBook models?</strong></h3>\n<p>We primarily repair MacBook models from 2016 onward, but we can still assist with older models, especially batteries and data recovery. If a repair isn’t financially sensible, we’ll recommend better alternatives upfront.</p>\n</div>\n\n</section>",
