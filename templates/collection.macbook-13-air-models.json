While most repair centres, including Apple, will write off a faulty logic board and quote you for a full replacement, we go deeper. We repair them properly.</p><p>Our technicians work under a microscope, diagnosing issues at component and microchip level. That could mean anything from replacing a burned-out MOSFET or shorted capacitor to rebuilding complete circuits after liquid damage. We’ve revived boards others declared dead and we do it every day.</p><p>It’s precise, delicate work, but it saves our clients hundreds (compared to Apple), keeps original data intact, and massively reduces electronic waste.</p><p>If Apple said your MacBook isn’t fixable and that you need a new one, there’s a good chance we’ll prove them wrong.</p>",

Our no-fix, no-fee policy applies to all standard MacBook repairs, and we’ll always explain what went wrong and what your options are.</p><p>In more advanced logic board diagnostics, if we’re unsuccessful (again, this is rare), we’ll suggest an alternative like a logic board replacement or data recovery, depending on what we find.</p><p>Either way, you’ll get a clear answer, not guesswork.</p><p>We’re here to fix the issue properly or give you the best path forward.

That includes blown capacitors, corroded traces, and shorted chips.

Once the repair begins, we run pre-checks to confirm the fault and rule out any secondary issues. After the repair, your MacBook goes through full post-repair testing and a final quality check, completed by a technician who wasn’t involved in the repair itself. This process helps us catch anything that could cause problems down the line.</p><p>We also invest in ongoing training. Our technicians are constantly learning and developing solutions for the latest MacBook issues, including those Apple hasn’t published repair procedures for yet.
