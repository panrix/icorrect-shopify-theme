Instead, they replace the entire device with a reconditioned unit and charge you for it. That’s why many clients choose to repair with us. We restore your original iPad using original parts, often for less than half the cost of Apple’s replacement quote.</p><p>Because we use original parts, Apple may still choose to service the device later at their discretion.
