On laminated iPads, such as iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini models, the glass and LCD are fused together, meaning the entire display must be replaced as a single unit. On non-laminated models, where the glass digitiser and LCD are separate, we can often replace only the damaged layer when appropriate.</p><p><br/></p><p>At iCorrect, we approach every iPad display repair with a repair-first mindset. We use original pulled Apple displays where available, and the highest quality OEM assemblies when original parts are no longer viable. Every display is tested for brightness uniformity, colour accuracy, True Tone functionality where applicable, and touch responsiveness. Repairs typically take two to three working days, allowing sufficient time for diagnostics, careful installation, and full post-repair testing.</p>",
