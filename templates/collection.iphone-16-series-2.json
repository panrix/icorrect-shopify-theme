Whether it’s a screen replacement, battery issue, or logic board repair, we stand by the quality of our work.<\/p><p>The warranty does not cover accidental damage or natural wear and tear, but if anything goes wrong because of the original fault, we’ll sort it.<\/p>","alignment":"left"}},"accordion_jNEQxe":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"heading":"Do iPad repairs void my Apple warranty?","sub_head":"<p>Technically, yes. As soon as the screen is broken or the housing is damaged, your iPad is already considered out of warranty by Apple.<\/p><p>Apple does not offer repairs for iPads. Instead, they replace the entire device with a reconditioned unit and charge you for it. That’s why many clients choose to repair with us. We restore your original iPad using original parts, often for less than half the cost of Apple’s replacement quote.<\/p><p>Because we use original parts, Apple may still choose to service the device later at their discretion.

Instead, they offer a full-device replacement with a reconditioned unit, which often costs in the region of £500 (or more), even for older models.<\/p><p>At iCorrect, we repair your original iPad using genuine parts wherever possible. That means if you’ve only damaged the screen or battery, we can fix just that part, without replacing the whole device.<\/p><p>Our average iPad screen repair is around half the cost of Apple’s replacement service.

For iPad Pro and Air models, the glass and display are fused together, which makes the process more complex but still possible.

Apple have not released replacement parts for these components, and both features are serialised to the original logic board for security reasons.<\/p><p>If either has stopped working, we can run diagnostics to confirm the cause, but if the sensor itself is damaged, it cannot be replaced or restored without Apple’s internal tools.<\/p><p>We’ll always be honest about what’s possible and help you explore your options if these features are no longer functioning.<\/p>","alignment":"left"}},"accordion_FMtcgy":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"heading":"Will my Apple Pencil still work after a repair?","sub_head":"<p>Yes, your Apple Pencil will continue to work exactly as it should after the repair.<\/p><p>Because we use original parts and complete the repair to factory standards, features like Pencil pairing and pressure sensitivity remain fully functional. We also test Apple Pencil functionality before completing the repair to make sure everything is working as expected.<\/p><p>In fact, we were one of the first companies to solve serialisation issues with Apple Pencil pairing, so you’re in safe hands.<\/p>","alignment":"left"}},"accordion_QdhiRR":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"heading":"How do you open iPads if they don’t have screws?","sub_head":"<p>iPads are sealed using a strong adhesive around the edge of the screen, which is why there are no visible screws.<\/p><p>To open the device, we use a controlled heating process to soften the adhesive, followed by precision tools to lift the screen without damaging the internal components. Once the repair is complete, we reseal the screen using an adhesive that matches the strength of the original maintaining the structure, fit, and finish Apple intended.<\/p><p>It’s a delicate process, but we’ve perfected it over years of working with every iPad model.<\/p>","alignment":"left"}},"accordion_zPz8mp":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"heading":"Can you repair logic board issues or water damage on an iPad?","sub_head":"<p>Yes, we can.
