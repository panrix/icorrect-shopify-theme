This means the liquid resistance is retained for everyday use, including showers and swimming. The repair costs significantly less than Apple’s full-screen or device replacement, and keeps your original parts intact. It is a better-quality repair, done the proper way.</p>",

We tested our repair using pressure chamber testing and shared our process with other professional repair centres worldwide.</p><p><br/>We do not rush these repairs. Curing the adhesive correctly takes time, which is why we ask for two to three working days. We only use original-quality glass, not generic parts, and every repair goes through full optical inspection, sealing, and post-repair water resistance checks.</p><p><br/>If your screen is broken but the display still works, this is the most cost-effective and sustainable repair you can get.</p>",
