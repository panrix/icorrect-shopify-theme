For phones and tablets, an iCloud backup is usually the fastest option. For computers, use Time Machine or another full backup method.</p><p>If the device is not turning on or is too unstable to back up, we can advise on the safest next step after inspection.

That can include detailed functional testing, internal inspection, and where relevant, board level investigation to isolate the area causing the fault.

We take a repair first approach where it makes technical and financial sense.</p><p>Board faults can present as no power, charging issues, random shutdowns, boot loops, or missing functions like audio, cameras, or connectivity. In many cases the board can be restored by repairing the affected circuit area rather than replacing the entire device.</p><p>These repairs require proper diagnostics and specialist equipment.

It also does not cover general wear and tear, for example normal battery ageing over time.</p><p>If you ever have an issue after a repair, we will inspect the device and explain exactly what is going on.

It also reduces compatibility issues that can happen with low quality aftermarket parts, and it is a more sustainable way to repair electronics.</p><p>For older models where original parts are no longer realistically available in good condition, we use high quality OEM alternatives.

The passcode is used only to reach the testing screens needed to confirm the device is working correctly.</p><p>If you prefer not to share a passcode, we can still complete many repairs.
