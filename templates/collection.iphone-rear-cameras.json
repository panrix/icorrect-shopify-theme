If your lens is cracked, or you’ve had a rear glass or lens repair elsewhere and now have fog, dust, or specks on your images, the camera may be contaminated or scratched. We check all of this as part of the repair.</p><p><br/>If your iPhone needs both the lens and camera module repaired, we’ll let you know in advance and complete both using original parts. In rare cases where the fault extends beyond the camera to the logic board, we’ll upgrade to a diagnostic and build a repair plan from there.
