Battery degradation is the most common issue we see with iPads, often caused by overcharging, extended periods on charge, or simply the natural ageing of the lithium-ion cells.</p><p><br/>At iCorrect, we replace iPad batteries using original pulled Apple batteries for newer models and the highest quality OEM batteries for older models where original parts are no longer available. Every battery goes through our rigorous pre-repair diagnostics and post-repair rundown tests to ensure it meets performance standards. This is why we ask for a minimum of 24 hours to complete the repair, although most are finished within two to three working days.</p>",

Our testing process confirms capacity, discharge rates, thermal behaviour, and overall battery health. If it is a newer iPad, we will use an original Apple battery pulled from a donor device and tested in-house. For older models, we use OEM batteries that are vetted to match Apple's specifications as closely as possible.</p><p><br/>If your iPad is underperforming, shutting down unexpectedly, or swelling, book it in for a battery replacement.
