Like all lithium-ion cells, Apple Watch batteries degrade over time. Whether it is from daily charging cycles, extended periods on charge, or natural ageing, battery failure is the most common issue we see across all Apple Watch models.<\/p><p><br\/>At iCorrect, we replace Apple Watch batteries using original Apple batteries pulled from donor devices and tested in-house. Each battery undergoes thorough diagnostics before and after installation to ensure it meets Apple’s performance standards. We ask for 2 to 3 working days to complete the repair because curing and sealing the watch to maintain its water resistance takes time.<\/p>","btn":"","link":"","btn_2":"","link_2":"","heading_size_desktop":38,"heading_size_mobile":24,"heading_line_height_desktop":46,"heading_line_height_mobile":36}},"featured_collection_AfhUDd":{"type":"featured-collection","name":"t:sections.featured-collection.presets.name","settings":{"title":"","heading_size":"h1","description":"","show_description":false,"description_style":"body","collection":"apple-watch-battery-repair-prices","columns_desktop":3,"full_width":false,"show_view_all":true,"view_all_style":"solid","enable_desktop_slider":false,"color_scheme":"scheme-1","image_ratio":"square","image_shape":"default","show_secondary_image":false,"show_vendor":false,"show_rating":false,"quick_add":"none","columns_mobile":"1","swipe_on_mobile":false,"padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"about_info_XAqnaH":{"type":"about-info","name":"About Info","settings":{"padding_top":50,"padding_bottom":50,"mob_padding_top":40,"mob_padding_bottom":40,"bg":"#fafafa","heading":"Our Process","details":"<p>A worn Apple Watch battery does more than shorten screen-on time.
