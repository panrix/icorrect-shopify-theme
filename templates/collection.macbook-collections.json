In those cases, we use the best quality OEM batteries available.</p>",

We repair them properly.</p><p>Our technicians work under a microscope, diagnosing issues at component and microchip level. That could mean anything from replacing a burned-out MOSFET or shorted capacitor to rebuilding complete circuits after liquid damage. We’ve revived boards others declared dead and we do it every day.</p><p>It’s precise, delicate work, but it saves our clients hundreds (compared to Apple), keeps original data intact, and massively reduces electronic waste.</p><p>If Apple said your MacBook isn’t fixable and that you need a new one, there’s a good chance we’ll prove them wrong.</p>",

That includes blown capacitors, corroded traces, and shorted chips. We then test each critical stage of the board to narrow down the fault.</p><p>Once we’ve confirmed the issue, we’ll send you a detailed report with a clear repair plan and quote so you’re fully informed before any work begins.</p>",

Once the repair begins, we run pre-checks to confirm the fault and rule out any secondary issues. After the repair, your MacBook goes through full post-repair testing and a final quality check, completed by a technician who wasn’t involved in the repair itself. This process helps us catch anything that could cause problems down the line.</p><p>We also invest in ongoing training. Our technicians are constantly learning and developing solutions for the latest MacBook issues, including those Apple hasn’t published repair procedures for yet. In many cases, we’re the ones figuring out how to fix new faults before anyone else.</p>",
