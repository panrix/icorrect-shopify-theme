Most of our parts are carefully reclaimed from genuine Apple devices and tested in-house to confirm full functionality. If there’s any sign of wear or damage, we refurbish the part back to the original factory standard before using it in a repair.</p><p>This approach means your iPhone keeps key features like True Tone, battery health tracking, and long-term performance with no compatibility issues or feature loss.</p><p>We also believe this is the most sustainable way to repair.

These use soft OLED technology, the same type used in Apple’s original screens, but they are aftermarket.</p><p>While they’re close in terms of display performance, you may notice slight differences in colour, brightness, or touch response compared to a genuine screen. We always recommend using an original part when possible, but we understand that for older devices or tighter budgets, a high-quality aftermarket screen can still be a good option.</p><p>We strongly advise against LCD screen replacements on OLED iPhones. LCDs run hotter, use more power, and often cause issues with touch sensitivity and display accuracy. If another company is offering you an LCD screen for an OLED iPhone, they’re not putting your device’s long-term performance first, and they’re cutting corners to save money at your expense.</p><p>If you’re unsure, we’ll talk you through both options so you can decide what’s right for you.</p>",

On devices running iOS 18 or later, we’re also able to calibrate the screen through settings so it’s recognised as a verified part.</p><p>If you choose an aftermarket screen, your iPhone will now show a message saying the part is “unverified.” This doesn’t affect how the screen works, but it’s Apple’s way of flagging that the part doesn’t have a matched serial number.</p><p>We’ll always explain the difference between the two options before the repair, so you know exactly what to expect.</p>",

We take a different approach.</p><p>Our technicians work under a microscope at microchip level, repairing faults like power failures, charging issues, and internal connection damage. These issues often happen when the iPhone is dropped and the two layers of the logic board start to separate.</p><p>If your iPhone is not powering on, not charging, or has been declared “dead” by another repair centre, there’s still a good chance we can bring it back to life.</p>",

All of our iPhone battery replacements support battery health monitoring in settings, so you can continue to track the performance and condition of your battery over time.</p><p>If we install a genuine Apple battery, your iPhone will recognise it as original, and you’ll see a message confirming the part as verified. On models where a genuine battery is no longer available, we use high-quality OEM replacements. These still show battery health in settings, but the message may not include Apple’s verification tag.</p><p>We’ll always tell you exactly what battery is being used and why.

This makes it far more repair-friendly, and we can replace just the glass using a genuine part.</p><p>However, for most earlier models, including the iPhone 14 Pro and anything before it, the rear glass is fused to the frame. In these cases, the entire housing needs to be replaced to maintain structural integrity, wireless charging alignment, and proper waterproofing.</p><p>You may have seen cheaper back glass-only repairs offered for these older models, but the quality is poor and they tend to crack easily.

This helps us check functions like Face ID, the camera, speaker, microphone, touchscreen response, and other key features before we return your device.</p><p>We do not access any personal apps, banking information, or private content. Our only goal is to confirm that everything is working as it should once the repair is complete.</p><p>If you prefer not to share your passcode, we can still carry out the repair.
