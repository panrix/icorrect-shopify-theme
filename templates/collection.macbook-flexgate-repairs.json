Over time, the cable frays or tears, cutting off the backlight when the lid is opened normally.</p><p>At iCorrect, we repair Flexgate by replacing and lengthening the backlight flex cable itself. This repair is carried out under a microscope by our microelectronics team, and avoids the need to replace the entire screen assembly.

We open your screen assembly, extend the original cable, and reinforce the weak point that caused the problem in the first place. There is no need to replace the entire screen. And if your camera has stopped working too, it’s the same fault with that cable and can be repaired too. Every repair is tested and documented before it is returned to you, and we stand behind our quality of repair with our two-year warranty.</p>",
