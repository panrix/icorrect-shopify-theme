Dust and debris can reach the rear camera module, damaging the optics, blurring your images, and sometimes causing complete camera failure. At iCorrect, we replace broken iPhone rear camera lenses using genuine sapphire glass with factory spec UV bonding. That means your camera lens stays in place, protects your internal camera module, and restores the appearance and performance of your iPhone.</p><p><br/>Our repairs are completed cleanly and securely using UV curing adhesive, not cheap double sided tape. Most rear lens repairs take under 2 hours and restore full camera clarity, focus, and protection. It is one of the simplest, most affordable ways to restore your iPhone properly and protect its resale value in the process.</p>",

Unlike factory glass, those lenses are not sapphire, do not protect your camera properly, and are rarely bonded with the correct adhesive. We use original lenses and the same UV cure bonding method Apple uses to ensure durability and alignment.</p><p><br/>If you plan to trade in your iPhone, a broken lens will heavily reduce its value. Apple charges up to £580 for a full rear system replacement. We repair just the lens accurately, affordably, and to factory standards.</p>",

This includes removal of the broken lens, cleaning of the housing, installation of a genuine sapphire lens, and full curing using factory grade UV adhesive.</p><p>If the rear camera is also damaged, we will quote that separately before any work begins.
