This ensures your new sensor is registered correctly to your device, allowing Face ID to function exactly as it did when the iPhone left the factory.</p><p><br/>Unlike general repair shops, we do not attempt to swap parts or spoof the Face ID circuit. This is not only unreliable, it poses a serious security risk. Instead, we work directly with Apple’s part ordering and calibration system to complete the repair properly. Face ID is now considered a core part of your iPhone’s security profile, and completing the repair the right way ensures your iPhone retains its full value.</p>",
