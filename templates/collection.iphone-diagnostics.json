We test every part properly.<br/><br/>At iCorrect, we specialise in repairs that Apple and other repair companies often refuse. We go far beyond surface-level checks. We disassemble the iPhone, test voltage and current draw, inspect the logic board under a microscope, and trace the fault to its source. It’s how we offer repairs that others cannot.</p><p><br/>Once the diagnostic is complete, we will provide you with a report and a confirmed quote. Then it’s up to you. If the repair cost is high, we’ll give you the best advice on whether to proceed or replace the device. Our diagnostics are done properly because we believe repair is nearly always the better option.</p>",
